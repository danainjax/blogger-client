# BLOGGER BUILD NOTES

1. Fetch show route is working, but need to research and explore HOW to add that to the dom in a more meaningful way. Currently being appended to a div at the bottom. Need to clear out page content and just show the current post clicked on.

2. - Edit function - be able to send an edit fecth with patch to modify the data in a post. 

3. - Category ID: Need to add category ID to the post form and update the postObj and fetch perhaps

4. Add attributes to a post: image_url
